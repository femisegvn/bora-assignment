Na crystallises in the bcc form, and the bcc-Na(100) is the most stable interface, which is still very reactive and spontaneously reacts with ambient oxygen to form oxygenated surfaces. To obtain the oxygenated surfaces, you can use the *add_adsorbate* function in the *ase.build* package. You can place the oxygens  ~1.6A from the surface (which does not much matter in the end, as the structure will be optimised, but giving a reasonable value will speed-up the geometry opt convergence).\n",
